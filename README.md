# Analyzing the Causes of User Growth Slowdown and Elevated Churn

## Executive Summary
This project provides a comprehensive analytics solution to identify the root causes behind slowing user growth and rising churn at PulseStack Technologies. Using MySQL Workbench for data cleaning and transformation and Power BI for visualization and insight generation, the project analyzes user behavior, subscriptions, engagement, and support interactions.

The solution enables PulseStack’s product and leadership teams to understand who is churning, why they are churning, and where growth friction exists, allowing for data-driven product and retention strategies.

## Business Problem
PulseStack has experienced:
- Slowing pace of new user growth
- An increase in monthly churn rate
- Declining engagement among previously active users
  
These challenges result in:
- Lost recurring revenue
- Higher customer acquisition costs
- Reduced lifetime value (LTV)
- Difficulty forecasting growth
Without a unified analytical view, teams struggle to pinpoint whether churn is driven by product usability issues, pricing, onboarding gaps, feature adoption, or support experience.

## Methodology
### Approach
- Data-Driven: Decisions supported by metrics like churn rate, DAU/MAU, retention cohorts
- User-Centric: Focus on user lifecycle and experience
- Scalable: Relational data model supporting future growth
- Maintainable: Clean SQL transformations and documented assumptions

### Technical Stack
- Database: MySQL (MySQL Workbench)
- Analytics & Visualization: Power BI, DAX
- Data Format: CSV (raw → cleaned → modeled)
- Version Control: Git / GitHub

### Development Process

1. Raw data ingestion (CSV)
2. Data cleaning & normalization using SQL
3. Relational modeling (keys, joins, constraints)
4. KPI calculation (churn, retention, engagement)
5. Dashboard creation and insight storytelling

### Skills Demonstrated

- SQL data cleaning & transformation
- Relational data modeling
- Power BI dashboarding
- KPI & churn analysis
- Business insight communication
- Product analytics thinking

## Results & Business Recommendations (to be completed after analysis)
### Key Results (Example Targets)

✅ Identified top churn drivers by plan type and tenure

✅ Found engagement drop-offs before churn events

✅ Quantified revenue impact of churn

✅ Highlighted onboarding and feature adoption gaps

### Business Recommendations (Example)

1. Improve onboarding for users who churn within 30 days
2. Introduce engagement nudges for low-activity teams
3. Revisit pricing tiers with highest churn-to-LTV ratio
